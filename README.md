# NVIDIA Riva Common

NVIDIA Riva is a GPU-accelerated SDK for building Speech AI applications that are customized for your use case and deliver real-time performance. This repo provides API definitions and other shared components used throughout the project.

## gRPC & Protocol Buffers

Riva clients use [gRPC](https://grpc.io) to communicate with the Riva server. The APIs and message types are defined in `riva/proto`. Complete API documentation is available in the [Riva user documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/reference/protos/protos.html).
